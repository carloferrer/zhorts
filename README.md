### What's This?
Aliases that help me do stuff.

### Installation
1. `cd` to wherever this repo was cloned
2. Run `source index.zsh`

**NOTE**: The installation script depends on `$PWD`, so attempting to `source` the `index.zsh` file from anywhere but where the repo is cloned (e.g., `source /path/to/zhorts/index.zsh`) won't work.
